How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Mamual approach will provide more control. We will not automatically commit unfinished coding. But
    it takes more effort for the developer to do the manually commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Computing project usually involves multiple files, a simple feature update also requires to 
    modify multiple files. For normal dorcument , user may only update one document at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using git log and examine the message assoicated with each commit to locate the targeted version. Using git diff to review and compare the difference between two consecutive commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control can help us to keep track of the changes we made. It is possoble to revert if the changes have caused problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use it to carry out version control for my future projects.
